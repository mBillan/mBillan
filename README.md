Hi! 
Hello, I'm Marwan Billan, a Senior Software Engineer at Shutterfly. I hold a degree in computer science from the Technion, where I also started my career as a software engineer at Intel. 
My passion for technology led me to pursue a Master's in Business Administration, as I believe that understanding both technical and business aspects is key to creating impactful solutions.

Driven by the dream of establishing my own software company to positively impact lives, I am dedicated to leveraging technology for meaningful change. 
Beyond my professional role, I hosted the @SmartUp Podcast, sharing knowledge and experiences.

I'm committed to continuous learning and look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals. 
Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey!
